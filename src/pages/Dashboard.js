          Here we show an integration with `react-router`. We add a sidebar
          where you can navigate between pages. Don't forget you can change
          pretty much anything since all components are exposed. This is just a
          reference implementation.

      <Paragraph textAlign="center" color="dark-5">
        You can click <RoutedAnchor path="/www" label="here" /> for a not found
        example. This is a link that does not exist in this app and it will
        intentionally show a not found page.
